# SocialNetworkVGI
Exploring social interaction patterns and drivers in VGI communities using a custom geovisual analytics tool

## Implementation
Force-graph (github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) and 3d-force-graph (github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph) were used to visualize the network with a force-directed layout in 2D and 3D, respectively. Leaflet (leafletjs.com) was used to draw nodes and edges of the network and render web map service (WMS) tiles provisioned by third parties (e.g., topography WMS by OpenTopMap (opentopomap.org) and land cover WMS by NAS (wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS)). Globe.gl (globe.gl) was utilized to visualize the spatial social network on a 3D globe. D3.js (d3js.org) was used to draw statistical graphs (e.g., pie chart and scatter plot). These libraries have built-in interactivity functions to support various user interactions with the visual elements (panning, zooming in and out, hovering over to highlight, etc.). In the background, Cytoscape.js (js.cytoscape.org) was utilized for basic network analysis (e.g., PageRank), jLouvain (github.com/noduslabs/jLouvain) for community detection using the Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008), and jStat.js (github.com/jstat/jstat) for statistical analyses (e.g., correlation coefficient).
